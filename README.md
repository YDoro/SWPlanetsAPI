This project was written using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) +  [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) + [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) the commits messages  trying to follow [ConvetionalCommits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/);

   #### Why Typescript?

With Typescript your code gains scalability easier with interfaces and types created as you need, becoming cleaner and easier to test, in this days TDD is not a idea its an necessity. 

#### Why Conventional Commits
Conventional commits is very useful if you're working on a open source code, the people who tries to read your commits with one or two minutes will understand the structure of they and will easily understand your development steps.
